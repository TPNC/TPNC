Welcome to our website.

Here you will be able to see what's the TPNC project.
        
        Below is a list of why you should invest in our Collection :
        
        - We give 20% of all the profit made from this nft collection to [CARE](https://care.org)
        
        - You will get access to THE BOX, a private online lounge only for Poor owners.
        
        - Get a 100 pixels to advertise whatever you want on [1millionpixels](https://1millionpixels.art)*
        
        - Get an exclusive "First Buyer" Hoodie if you have been one of the first buyers of a poor.
        
Convinced ? [**Then Join us !**](https://opensea.io/collection/the-poor-nft)

Is the project serious ? And is there any buyers already ?
        
        Yes the project is very serious. JasonLemon has spent countless hours designing all those NFTs
        in hope that it will be bought, all the perks given once you buy a poor are instantly available
        and we will let you do what you want with it.
        
        Considering the fact that this collection just recently dropped, there's still a lot of
        nft to sell, but every day, we are getting more and more known.
        
How frequent are the drop ?
        
        Poor drops are made every solstice of the year (or 2x a year), we do this to avoid having too many 
        nfts running on the market at the same time.

How many NFTs are dropped every solstice ?
        
        A Poor drop contains 100 unique Poors, all of them starting at the same price : 4.63MATIC
        
Why are the NFTs in MATIC and not ETH ?
        
        Supplying such a big amount of NFTs in ETH would require a lot of expenses, and right now, our
        supplier, JasonLemon, doesn't have enough funds.
        
Why this project and not another ?
        
        Always a tricky question to answer... You can see TPNC as a great way to get into NFTs without
        having to spend all your savings just to get a picture. When buying a Poor, you're buying more
        than just a picture, you're buying an art piece that could resell for a lot ! And at the same
        time you also donate to charity. Isn't that awesome ?
